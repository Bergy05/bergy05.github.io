My github account is connected to my personal email as it is something I have used slightly before. I am also quite confused of how you would like us to do this so hopefully this is right.
I first went to github.com and downloaded their GitHub Desktop app and then created a respository then cloned it to the app inevetibly putting the repository onto my local computer.
# About Me
## Interests
I am interensted in a lot of things I tend to be more of a hands on person. This meaning I usually work on cars and other things of that nature but cannot do it for work as I find more problem solving type interests are better for my work ethic. Hence why I am taking these classes as I have a logisitical mindset and find this very interesting to learn about. 
## Websites I Recommend 
  - www.youtube.com - I find myself using this as more than just entertainment, as there is a lot of useful information on here that has gotten me through things I would have no clue doing without seeing a video on it.
  - www.rockauto.com - This is a wonderful website if you would like to find parts for a car. I use this website on almost every project I do as they have a full category of parts at very good prices.
