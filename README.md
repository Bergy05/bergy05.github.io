My github account is connected to my personal email as it is something I have used slightly before. I am also quite confused of how you would like us to do this so hopefully this is right.
I first went to github.com and downloaded their GitHub Desktop app and then created a respository then cloned it to the app inevetibly putting the repository onto my local computer.
